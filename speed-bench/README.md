## Benchmarking

Here we collect prefill and generation speed obtained with different hardware.

Run `ds4-bench` as:

```
./ds4-bench \
  -m ds4flash.gguf \
  --prompt-file speed-bench/promessi_sposi.txt \
  --ctx-start 2048 \
  --ctx-max 65536 \
  --step-incr 2048 \
  --gen-tokens 128
```

Provide PR including your numbers if your hardware was not already tested.
Call the benchmark csv file something like `m3_max.csv` or alike, so that
it is clear what hardware was used for the benchmark.

To generate an SVG graph from a CSV file:

```
python3 speed-bench/plot_speed.py speed-bench/m3_max.csv --title "M3 Max t/s"
```

The script uses only the Python standard library. By default it writes a file
next to the CSV using the `_ts.svg` suffix, such as `speed-bench/m3_max_ts.svg`.

### CUDA prefill audit

`cuda-prefill-audit.sh` captures both an ordinary 2K measurement and an Nsight
Systems trace of the same production pipeline. The trace starts after model
loading and workspace allocation, so the report contains the prefill itself
rather than the roughly 100 GiB model-residency setup. It also records the GPU
inventory and topology, NUMA layout, exact pipeline schedule and transfer-byte
accounting, GPU telemetry, kernel/API summaries, and the raw `.nsys-rep` and
SQLite trace.

The audit explicitly selects the established baseline: Q8-to-F16 cache and the
two-stage pipeline on, experimental attention head splitting off. It does not
enable the existing event-based MoE, attention-output, or layer-stage profilers;
those synchronize streams and alter the schedule being measured.

```bash
cd ~/ds4-iq2-q4
export MODEL="$PWD/gguf/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731-IQ2-IQ2-Q4.gguf"
export PROMPT="$PWD/speed-bench/promessi_sposi.txt"

./speed-bench/cuda-prefill-audit.sh
```

The default logical tier order is `0,2,1,3`. On a machine whose physical
NVLink pairs are `0<->1` and `2<->3`, this makes logical tier 2 the partner of
tier 0 and logical tier 3 the partner of tier 1 while the two pipeline homes
remain logical tiers 0 and 1. Override `GPU_DEVICES` only when the physical
topology differs.

### SM75 deep prefill audit

`cuda-prefill-deep-audit.sh` performs the next evidence pass in one command:

- repeated, uninstrumented 21/22 and 25/18 placement sweeps;
- one device-only tile audit recording actual owned pairs, tile count, active
  experts, padding, and owner identity for every layer and microbatch;
- four narrowly filtered Nsight Compute reports: IQ2 gate/up and Q4 down from
  one early and one late layer.

The tile audit extends the already-running tile-offset kernel. It adds no
per-layer launch, timing event, synchronization, or host read. Its buffers are
allocated before the measured prefill and copied once per GPU after the
existing prefill synchronization and timing window.

```bash
cd ~/ds4-iq2-q4
export MODEL="$PWD/gguf/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731-IQ2-IQ2-Q4.gguf"
export PROMPT="$PWD/speed-bench/promessi_sposi.txt"

./speed-bench/cuda-prefill-deep-audit.sh
```

The default suite measures context frontiers from 2K through 64K three times
for each placement. Set `PROMPT_MANIFEST` to a tab-separated `label<TAB>path`
file to run the same fixed frontiers over multiple prompt corpora. Set
`RUN_NCU=0` when only the placement and tile evidence is needed. The script
always packages partial results on exit and records the failing phase in
`run-status.txt`.

Use `DEEP_AUDIT_DIR` to select or resume a directory; the generic `AUDIT_DIR`
used by the earlier Nsight Systems script is intentionally ignored. To resume
only the four Nsight Compute reports after enabling performance-counter access:

```bash
export DEEP_AUDIT_DIR="$PWD/prefill-deep-audit-YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ"
SKIP_BUILD=1 SKIP_PLACEMENT=1 SKIP_TILE=1 \
  ./speed-bench/cuda-prefill-deep-audit.sh
```

If the system restricts counters to administrators, set `NCU_USE_SUDO=1` for
the resume run or change the NVIDIA driver profiling-permission policy.

### Full-Q4 SM75 evidence pass

`cuda-q4-prefill-evidence.sh` keeps measurement and diagnostics separate. It
runs the fixed prompt suite once on the untouched 22/21 production path, then
uses independent processes for Q8-cache coverage, Nsight Systems runtime
branch coverage, and Nsight Compute replay. The Q8 audit records every
Q8-to-F16 cache attempt, including the layer/module context, device, hit/fill
or native-Q8 result, reason, and cache high-water mark. It then selects two
actual native-Q8 projections as the dense-kernel profiler targets; launch
indices are not guessed.

The Q4 gate/up captures are scoped by layer and token offset through the CUDA
profiler API and filtered to the SM75 tile8 kernel. The dense-Q8 captures use
the same scope plus the audit-selected module and verify that the projection
was still uncached in the profiling process. Each targeted scope verifies that
the graph is already on the requested physical GPU and synchronizes that
context before closing, so an asynchronously queued kernel cannot fall outside
the profiler range.

Nsight Compute uses **application replay**, a file-backed replay buffer, and a
focused metric list by default. It never uses kernel replay for this model.
Kernel replay snapshots every allocation accessible to the selected kernel;
with a fully resident 153 GiB model that can spill tens of GiB per pass into
host memory and make Linux unresponsive without producing an OOM kill. The
focused set records duration, launch resources, achieved occupancy, eligible
warps, IMMA utilization, DRAM/L1/L2 activity and hit rates, and the relevant
scoreboard/MIO stalls. `NCU_SET=targeted` and `NCU_SET=full` remain explicit,
slower opt-ins, but also use application replay.

The profiler follows child processes explicitly and filters them back to
`ds4-bench`; this is required by Nsight Compute's Linux launcher behavior on
the target host. Hidden Nsight configuration is disabled. Every capture must
also contain the DS4 start/stop markers and exactly one raw report row matching
the requested kernel, physical device, process, and duration metric. A
zero-kernel warning or header-only report is a hard failure.

```bash
cd ~/ds4-iq2-q4
export MODEL="$PWD/gguf/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-Q4KExperts-F16HC-F16Compressor-F16Indexer-Q8Attn-Q8Shared-Q8Out-chat-v2-imatrix.gguf"
export PROMPT="$PWD/speed-bench/promessi_sposi.txt"

./speed-bench/cuda-q4-prefill-evidence.sh
```

Replace the example `MODEL` value with the exact full-Q4 file on the machine.
The script rejects a missing model rather than searching for one implicitly.
Set `PROMPT_MANIFEST` to reuse the fixed multi-prompt suite. Set
`NCU_USE_SUDO=1` if performance counters require administrative access. As
with the deep audit, partial results are archived on failure. Resume only the
Compute captures while preserving the completed benchmark, cache audit, and
Systems trace with:

```bash
cd ~/ds4-iq2-q4
export MODEL="$PWD/gguf/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-Q4KExperts-F16HC-F16Compressor-F16Indexer-Q8Attn-Q8Shared-Q8Out-chat-v2-imatrix.gguf"
export PROMPT="$PWD/speed-bench/promessi_sposi.txt"
export Q4_EVIDENCE_DIR="$PWD/q4-prefill-evidence-20260803T005438Z"

SKIP_BUILD=0 \
SKIP_BASELINE=1 \
SKIP_COVERAGE=1 \
RUN_NSYS=0 \
RUN_NCU=1 \
NCU_SET=focused \
NCU_USE_SUDO=1 \
./speed-bench/cuda-q4-prefill-evidence.sh
```

On resume, the script validates the model, prompt suite, device order, context
settings, and profiler frontier against the original `manifest.txt`. It keeps
that file intact, writes a timestamped resume manifest for the new commit, and
atomically marks `run-status.txt` as `state=running` before profiling. Only
`state=finished`, `exit_status=0`, and `last_phase=complete` together indicate
a complete archive.

### SM80 to SM75 dispatch and resource audit

[`CUDA_SM80_TO_SM75_DISPATCH_MATRIX.md`](../CUDA_SM80_TO_SM75_DISPATCH_MATRIX.md)
is the source-reviewed architecture matrix for the normal DeepSeek V4 Flash
CUDA path. It covers dense projections, attention, indexer, all four routed
expert quant combinations, decode, cache-dependent dispatch, and four-GPU
orchestration. Unknown compiled resources are marked explicitly rather than
inferred from source.

Generate paired cubin resource and instruction reports without loading a model:

```bash
cd ~/ds4-iq2-q4
./speed-bench/cuda-sm-dispatch-resource-audit.sh
```

The script compiles `ds4_cuda.cu` for both `sm_75` and `sm_80`, records the
complete source kernel/launch/gate inventories, extracts per-function cubin
resource usage, and counts IMMA, HMMA, DP4A, load, and barrier instructions.
It packages the report as `sm-dispatch-resource-<commit>-<timestamp>.tar.gz`.
No `MODEL` variable is required because this audit does not execute inference.

To reparse and repackage an existing audit without recompiling its CUDA
objects, name its existing directory explicitly:

```bash
OUT_DIR="$PWD/sm-dispatch-resource-<commit>-<timestamp>" \
REPARSE_ONLY=1 \
./speed-bench/cuda-sm-dispatch-resource-audit.sh
```

Object-wide instruction totals are compiler-coverage checks only. Both objects
contain symbols excluded by runtime architecture gates; use the paired
per-function tables together with the production dispatch matrix.
